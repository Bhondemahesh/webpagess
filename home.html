    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maharashtra State Grape Growers Association was established in 1960, originally at Baramati for the sole purpose of addressing the problems of Grape growers on a single platform.<br> 
        <hr>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems at that time revolved around the technical aspects of viticulture and hence the need for the association was felt. <br> 
        <hr>
        The main objectives of the association were to provide technical back up to growers through research and development, extension services, arranging seminars and group discussions, importing and distributing some important viticulture inputs like gibberellic acid etc.,<br>
        <hr>which were not available to the growers in India, studying and adopting new technologies, adoption of improved varieties. <br> 
        <hr>At the beginning, the number of members was just 60 with approximately 800 acres under cultivation. In 1972, the association moved its headquarters to Pune, so that all the four major grape growing areas Viz. <br>
         <hr>Nashik, Sangli, Solapur, and Pune could have easy access to the association.<br>
         <hr> Over the last decade, regional offices were set up at Nashik, Sangli and Solapur in addition to Pune to facilitate better services to grape growers. 
        <hr>This organization is one of the premiere and renowned organization today working with the sole purpose of addressing the problems of grape growers on a single platform. 
        <br>
        <hr>This organization is growing at an exponential rate and has 27,000 registered members, accounting for approximately 80,000 hectares of land under grape gardens. <br>
         <hr>This fact is self explanatory for signifying the contribution of organization in the field of viticulture.
        <hr> This organization is consistently striving to give new vision and dimension to the field of viticulture, at par with the global standard.  This has become possible only because of the constant support we have received from the government and other concerned authorities
